🧠 MemoTag Speech Intelligence
      A proof-of-concept voice analysis pipeline to detect early signs of cognitive decline using audio signal processing and unsupervised machine learning.

🔍 Key Features

      Extracts speech rate, pitch variability, hesitation markers, and pauses from audio samples
      
      Applies NLP-based coherence checks on transcribed text

      Uses Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and KMeans for clustering insights

📈 Outputs

      Risk scores indicating potential cognitive anomalies
      
      Visualizations: pairplots, pitch variability histograms, and risk heatmaps
      
      Scalable and API-ready architecture for real-time analysis

🎯 Goal
      To offer an interpretable, lightweight system for early cognitive assessment via voice — ideal for health tech prototypes and research.
